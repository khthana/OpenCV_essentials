**SIFT** stands for `Scale Invariant Feature Transform`, it is a feature extraction method (among others, such as `HOG feature extraction`) where image content is transformed into local feature coordinates that are invariant to translation, scale and other image transformations.

Below are the advantages of SIFT:

- Locality: Features are local; robust to occlusion and clutter.
- Distinctiveness: Individual features extracted can be matched to a large dataset of objects.
- Quantity: Using SIFT, we can extract many features from small objects.
- Efficiency: SIFT is close to real-time performance.
