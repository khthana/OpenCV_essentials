**Image segmentation** is the process of partitioning an image into multiple different regions (or segments). 
The goal is to change the representation of the image into an easier and more meaningful image.

K-Means clustering is unsupervised machine learning algorithm that aims to partition N observations into K clusters in which each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean. A cluster refers to a collection of data points aggregated together because of certain similarities. For image segmentation, clusters here are different image colors.
